# About 
* This is my first group project using Java and <Academia de CÃ³digo_>'s Simpl grfx library, after 3 weeks of bootcamp.
* We had 10 nights to develop this project as the classes didn't stop during the day.

# Purple-porple
* We were given a colour as theme for our game wich was phlox-purple , and using the name of the two classes (<SHELLbys_> && <Shhpartans_>) we managed to get this beautiful game done.

# How to Run 

1 - Open terminal and move to the folder where purple-porple.jar is stored 

2 - Run "java -jar purple-porple.jar" on your terminal

3 - Enjoy
